## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt more about CSS backgrounds, CSS positioning, CSS variables, responsive web design and many more

### Continued development

I need to focus more on writing clean and reusable code and also learn more about the CSS BEM model of naming classes.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-color-filter-generator](https://angel-rs.github.io/css-color-filter-generator/) - This helped me to create CSS filter property to change the color of SVG images
